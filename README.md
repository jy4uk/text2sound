# text2sound
This project is meant to be a creative approach to composing musical pieces based on text. The [text2sound.py](text2sound.py) file can take a .txt file as input and will read each line and accordingly assign different musical parameters to generated notes. Once a .mid (midi file) has been generated, a user can import the .mid file into their DAW (digital audio workstation) of choice and listen to the corresponding file.


To try out the program, open the python file in a preferred IDE (Pycharm is recommended). Create a new .txt file and type whatever inputs necessary. For examples, look at the [test.txt](test.txt) file in the repo. The program takes each line in the .txt file and turns it into one discrete note so write the .txt file accordingly. The program will output a .mid file which can then be imported into a preferred DAW (Logic Pro X recommended) and played. It is recommended to alter the default instrument to achieve more unique sounds.
